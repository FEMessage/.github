## Issue Reporting Guidelines

- Always create new issues using [template](https://github.com/FEMessage/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

## Pull Request Guidelines

- You'd better take a moment to konw about our component developing tool: [vue-sfc-cli](https://github.com/FEMessage/vue-sfc-cli)

- Please submit Pull Request using [template](https://github.com/FEMessage/.github/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

- The `master` branch is just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in `dev` branches. **Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**

- **DO NOT** checkin `dist` in the commits.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub will automatically squash it before merging.

## Development Setup

You will need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) **version 8+**

After cloning the repo, run:

``` bash
$ yarn # install the dependencies of the project
```

### Committing Changes

Commit messages should follow the [commit message convention](https://conventionalcommits.org/) so that changelogs can be automatically generated. Commit messages will be automatically validated upon commit. If you are not familiar with the commit message convention, you can use `npm run commit` instead of `git commit`, which provides an interactive CLI for generating proper commit messages.

### Commonly used NPM scripts

``` bash
# develop with hot reload
$ yarn dev

# if add new feature, you may need add releated docs
$ vi docs/xxx.md

# run unit tests
$ yarn test
```
